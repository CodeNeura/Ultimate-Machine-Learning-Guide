# 💡 How to Choose an ML Model  
(Machine Learning Model Selection Guide)

Machine Learning models are different for every task.  
You just need to see:  
**"What type of answer do I want?"**  
Based on that, the model is chosen.

---

## 📌 1. If the Answer Should Be "Yes" or "No"

**Examples:**

- Is this email spam or not?  
- Is this person a diabetes patient or not?

👉 **Use this model:**  
`Logistic Regression` or `Naive Bayes`  
**Their job:** To tell only "Yes" or "No".

---

## 📌 2. If the Answer Should Be a Number

**Examples:**

- What will be the price of this house?  
- How many sales will be next month?

👉 **Use this model:**  
`Linear Regression` or `XGBoost Regressor`  
**Their job:** To give a number (e.g. 50,000 rupees)

---

## 📌 3. If You Want to Make Groups Without Labels

**Example:**

- I have 1,000 customers. I want to group them into who shops and who doesn’t.

👉 **Use this model:**  
`K-Means`  
**Its job:** To make automatic groups.

---

## 📌 4. If You Want to Predict the Future Over Time

**Examples:**

- What will the weather be next week?  
- What will sales be next month?

👉 **Use this model:**

- `ARIMA` (for simple data)  
- `LSTM` (if deep learning is needed)

---

## 📌 5. If You Want to Recognize from a Photo

**Example:**

- Is there a cat or dog in this image?

👉 **Use this model:**  
`CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)`

---

## 📌 6. If You Want to Understand the Meaning of Text

**Examples:**

- Is the review happy or sad?  
- Is the comment good or bad?

👉 **Use this model:**

- `Naive Bayes` (simple)  
- `BERT` (advanced level)
